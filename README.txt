Insta to Mastodon Reposter

This Node.js automation tool visits posts from specified Instagram accounts, takes a screenshot, and reposts it with a caption to a Mastodon account. It's designed to run daily and only repost content from the previous day.

Features

- Uses Patchwright — a drop-in replacement for Playwright with stealth patches to avoid bot detection
- Captures screenshots of Instagram posts instead of downloading media
- Filters for posts from yesterday only
- Reposts screenshot + caption to Mastodon
- Uses persistent browser data to reduce repeated logins
- Cron/launchd-compatible — can be automated daily
